# OS Lab Directory  

## Overview  
This repository contains materials and implementations related to the **Operating Systems Lab**. It includes a presentation on **Fedora**, C++ programs solving OS-related problems, and a Shell script for a simple calculator.  

## Contents  

1. **Fedora Presentation** (`fedora_presentation.pptx`)  
   - A detailed presentation on the Fedora operating system, covering its history, features, architecture, package management, and use cases.  

2. **OS-related C++ Programs** (`cpp/`)  
   - Contains C++ implementations of problems related to **process scheduling, memory management, file handling, and synchronization.**  

3. **Shell Script Calculator** (`shell/calculator.sh`)  
   - A basic calculator script written in Shell that supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.**  

## Usage  

- **Fedora Presentation**: Open the `.pptx` file using **Microsoft PowerPoint**, **LibreOffice Impress**, or any compatible viewer.  
- **C++ Programs**: Compile and run using `g++` or any C++ compiler:  
  ```sh
  g++ filename.cpp -o output
  ./output
  ```  
- **Shell Calculator**: Run the script in a Unix-based terminal:  
  ```sh
  chmod +x calculator.sh
  ./calculator.sh
  ```  

## Requirements  

- **For C++ Programs:** GCC compiler (`g++`)  
- **For Shell Scripts:** Unix-based OS with a Bash shell
